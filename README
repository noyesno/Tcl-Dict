Updated: 17 November 2005.

The original dict extension from May 2004 has been updated with todays code
from the Tcl CVS repository.

This version doesn't have support for mp_int, because 8.4 has no such support.

April 2004.

This is a backport of the Tcl 8.5 [dict] command for Tcl 8.4. 

Most code was taken straight from from the Tcl-core CVS HEAD and
sampleextension on 14 April 2004. I glued it together with the help of
Donal K. Fellows, Don G. Porter and others to make this extension.

Perhaps the most significant change in the code is that it is slighly
less efficient than the real thing, mostly because some optimization
tricks are only available when linking against tclInt.h, not tcl.h.

UNIX BUILD
==========

Building under most UNIX systems is easy, just run the configure script
and then run make. For more information about the build process, see
the tcl/unix/README file in the Tcl src dist. The following minimal
example will install the extension in the /opt/tcl directory.

	$ cd tclDict
	$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/tcl
	$ make
	$ make install

WINDOWS BUILD
=============

The recommended method to build extensions under windows is to use the
Msys + Mingw build process. This provides a Unix-style build while
generating native Windows binaries. Using the Msys + Mingw build tools
means that you can use the same configure script as per the Unix build
to create a Makefile.

If you have VC++ then you may wish to use the files in the win
subdirectory and build the extension using just VC++. These files have
been designed to be as generic as possible but will require some
additional maintenance by the project developer to synchronise with
the TEA configure.in and Makefile.in files. Instructions for using the
VC++ makefile are written in the first part of the Makefile.vc
file.
